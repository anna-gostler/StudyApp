(check: do not add vocab already in currentVocabs)
=> fill currentVocabs as many seen as there are due (max minreapeated), rest: unseen

--> upload to github/heroku
--> remove todos
--> remove unnecessary files


>> dev = false in websecurity configuration

>> upload to github + heroku link


front vocabservice: moveforward:
if (! v.isNew){
currentRepeatedWords --;
}

ref: https://web.dev/promises/

in some lines of frontend vocab service its duedate in others dueDate why? (one retrieved from database? different formats also)
weird: addDate in serverresponse (http://localhost:8080/api/vocab/randomunseen)
not visible in cosmos db (via azure button in left panel)

fix font file too large
is it downloaded all the time??


nice to have
